# etag-spring-boot
Let try to understand how ETag header works:

   1. On the first request, server create hash code of response and set hash code as ETag in response header, server will 200 response
   2. If again the same request generated by browser at that browser will send if-Non-match header which contains previous same response’s ETag value
  3.  When server will find if-non-match header at that time complete response’s has code with if-non-match. If both are same at that time server will send 304 response code so the browser will understand that no need to read response it’s same response which already been cache so the browser will use the cache.

4. In short, If the same request comes again from the same browser to server and response is same in that case server will send 304 code so the browser will not read or download complete response from the server instead it will use previously cache data. If response it very from previous response then the server will send a new response with a status code 200 so the browser will cache new response will be useful in the feature.
